PCSX2 usb plugin based on linuzappz, shadow, gigaherz et al. usb plugin using usb host emulation code from qemu.

USB packets with FFB commands are passed staight to the wheel when using raw input API mode.
As they are pretty much vendor specific, force feedback probably works with Logitech wheels only.

As such, DInput (DirectX) mode is recommended for non-Logitech wheels.

Linux note: if joystick is type of "gamepad" (xbox etc) then analog sticks/buttons should work mostly out-of-the-box.
No rumble effect though yet. Also axis input is (too) linear so steering is a little _spazzy_.

For info about Logitech's FF protocol, go to https://opensource.logitech.com/opensource/index.php/Technical_Information

Linux Hidraw support
-------

Raw force feedback commands can be sent directly to Logitech wheels that support it when using `evdev` API through `hidraw` device. Copy the udev rule to (usually) `/etc/udev/rules.d`. Add your account to `plugdev` group if it is not already or modify the udev rules to fit your needs.

Mass storage device
=======

Now includes preliminary support for usb mass storage devices. Create a image file and format it.
http://www.fysnet.net/mtools.htm or http://www.ltr-data.se/opencode.html/ might be of some help to windows users.

A 256MB and 4GB image file is included in `dist` folder.
You should be able to access files in image file with 7-zip ( http://7-zip.org/ ).

On linux:

	truncate -s 256M usb.img
	mkfs.vfat -F 32 usb.img
	
Optionally mount image for file transfer:

	losetup -f usb.img
	mount /dev/loopX /mnt #or somewhere else

or let `mount` automagically set up a loopback device:

	mount usb.img /mnt
	
Of course, if a PS2 game/program itself can format a drive then you can just use some random file, heh.

Singstar
========

You can use 2 mono/stereo mics or one stereo mic with separate per-channel input (select same microphone for both players; left channel = P1, right channel = P2).

Windows: Uses Core Audio API. As such, it needs Vista or newer.

Linux: PulseAudio only for now atleast.

Keyboard/mouse (HID) support
==========

When using a mouse device, uncheck "Double-click toggles fullscreen mode" and check "Always hide mouse cursor" in emulation settings under "GS Window".

To (un)lock cursor to window:
* On windows, press SHIFT + F11. "Alt-tabbing" should also free cursor.
* On linux, use OnePAD plugin for controller (because technical reasons, for now atleast) and press SHIFT + F12


Building
==========

On Windows:

	cd some/where/USBqemu-wheel
	cmake . -G"Visual Studio 16 2019" -A Win32 -B build-win32
	cmake --build build-win32 --config Release
	cmake --build build-win32 --target install
or

	cd some/where/USBqemu-wheel
	cmake . -G"Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64 -B build-win64
	cmake --build build-win64 --config Release
	cmake --build build-win64 --target install

or optionally specify where PCSX2 plugin folder is

	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=some\where\pcsx2\plugins -P cmake_install.cmake


On 64bit OSs, enable multilib and install gcc-multilib (and g++-multilib if it didn't already).

On Arch linux, basically:

	cd some/where/USBqemu-wheel
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/lib32/pcsx2 # optionally also `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/linux-compiler-i386-multilib.cmake`
	make -j $(nproc)
	sudo make install

On Ubuntu and derivatives, it is probably better to setup a virtual machine image or chroot as the 32bit dev packages may uninstall 64bit packages.

See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebootstrapChroot

	sudo apt-get install debootstrap schroot
	sudo debootstrap --arch=i386 zesty  ~/zesty-i386

On 32bit OS:

	sudo apt-get install gcc g++ libgtk2.0-dev libpulse-dev
	cd some/where/USBqemu-wheel
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/pcsx2
	make -j $(nproc)
	sudo make install

or just use package builder:

	cd some/where/USBqemu-wheel
	TARGET_DISTRIB=[ubuntu or debian] dpkg-buildpackage -b -uc -us
	sudo dpkg -i ../libusbqemu-wheel-unstable_*.deb

On 64bit OS (This will probably kill your desktop!):

	sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386 # if needed
	sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib g++-multilib libgtk2.0-dev:i386 libpulse-dev:i386 # you may need to manually specify the packages that cause unmet dependencies
	cd some/where/USBqemu-wheel
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/linux-compiler-i386-multilib.cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/pcsx2
	make -j $(nproc)
	sudo make install

CMake defines:

* `PLUGIN_BUILD_RAW` (bool, TRUE) for raw api (windows)
* `PLUGIN_BUILD_DX` (bool, TRUE) for dinput (windows)
* `PLUGIN_BUILD_PULSE` (bool, TRUE) for PulseAudio (singstar) (linux)
* `PLUGIN_BUILD_DYNLINK_PULSE` (bool, TRUE) dlopen PulseAudio or link to lib (linux)
* `PLUGIN_BUILD_WITH_DXSDK` (bool, FALSE) build with DX2010 SDK (windows)
* `PLUGIN_FIND_WINSDK` (bool, FALSE) to find newest installed windows platform toolset/sdk. Probably unnecessary when building with Visual Studio. (windows)
* `PLUGIN_ENABLE_UNITY_BUILD` (bool, FALSE) concat source files into one huge one before building, WIP.

DInput should be using Windows platform toolset/sdk now.

Optionally, you can still use 2010 DirectX SDK. CMake looks for %DXSDK_DIR% environment variable.
